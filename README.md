FIFA World Cup Data Assignment

This repository contains a comprehensive data model and application for the FIFA World Cup competitions. The project covers the following key aspects:

**Data Modeling**: Developed an Entity/Attribute (E/A) model that encapsulates teams, players, staff, matches, and referee details. Transitioned the E/A model into a relational model for a more structured representation.

**Database Implementation**: Utilized SQL on PostgreSQL to implement the relational model. The database is populated with diverse datasets ensuring meaningful insights during queries.

**Query Optimization**: Crafted and tested various SQL queries that retrieve data efficiently, emphasizing the importance of non-empty and significant results.

**Java GUI Application**: A user-friendly graphical interface built using Java, enabling users to interact seamlessly with the database. The application is enhanced with visual components from Java Swing/Awt and JavaFX.

**ORM Enhancement** : Leveraged ORM tools, specifically Hibernate or JPA, for an enhanced and intuitive database interaction experience.

The goal of this project is to provide an end-to-end solution for storing, retrieving, and analyzing data related to the FIFA World Cup competitions.
